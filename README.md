[MongoDB Project](https://github.com/Akarsh654/SQLite-and-MongoDB-Projects/tree/main/MiniProject2%20(MongoDB)):
This project has 2 phases. 

In Phase1 the system begins by asking the user for the port number they wish to connect to then the database is built from the json files. An array called tags is created for every post which contains every word in the title and body. An index is built on this array to facilitate faster searching.  

The overall time to complete the Phase1 was optimized and we managed to bring it down from 15 minutes to about 3 minutes.

 
In Phase2 the system begins by asking the user for the port number they wish to connect to.  
Then the user is asked if they wish to provide a userid. The user must type y or n to select an action.   
For every invalid user input throughout the program, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid input.   
 
If the user selects y: The user is prompted to enter a uid and the user report is displayed.   
Then the menu options are displayed. The task menu contains 6 options, one for each task and one to exit the program.  
If the user selects exit at any point in the program then a goodbye message is displayed and the program is terminated.  

The task menu options include:  
1.  Post a question
2.  Search for questions
3.  Question action-Answer
4.  Question action- List Answers
5.  Post action-Vote
6.  Exit
